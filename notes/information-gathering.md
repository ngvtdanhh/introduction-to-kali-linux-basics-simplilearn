# 🔍 Information Gathering in Kali Linux

Information gathering is the first step in the penetration testing process.  
Kali Linux provides multiple tools for active and passive reconnaissance.

## 📡 Passive Recon
- `whois` – Domain information
- `nslookup` – DNS lookup
- `theHarvester` – Email & subdomain enumeration

## ⚡ Active Recon
- `nmap` – Network scanning and host discovery
- `nikto` – Web server vulnerability scanning
- `dirb` – Directory brute-forcing

**Best Practice**: Always verify that you have legal permission before scanning any target.
